This temporary project allows you to connect your **Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con** to a Windows PC using BLE and vJoy.

---

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone this repository :
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Logan-Gaillard/Joy2Win.git
   cd Joy2Win
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies :
    ```
    pip install bleak pyvjoy pynput
    ```

4.  Install vJoy :
    https://sourceforge.net/projects/vjoystick/

5. Configure vJoy :  
        - Open "Configure vJoy"  
        - Select controller 1  
        - Set 24 buttons or higher  
        - Restart your computer  

## 🕹️ Usage

1. Copy the `config-exemple.ini` file, rename it to `config.ini`, and edit it according to your needs.

2. Run the script in the Joy2Win directory (wherever you cloned it):
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3. Follow the instructions displayed when the script starts.

4. Confirm that the controller is connected.
        - Search in Windows for "Set up USB game controllers".
        - You should see "vJoy Device" there.

Your Joy-Con 2 controllers are now connected to your Windows computer.

## 🎮 (Optional) Next Steps - Steam

To connect your controller for use with Steam games, In Steam, navigate to Settings > Controller > Begin Setup.

If you're using Both Joy-Cons, you can quickly configure every button (inlcuding the C button and the SL/SR buttons) by first copying the below:
```
a:b4,b:b5,x:b6,y:b7,dpleft:b9,dpright:b8,dpup:b10,dpdown:b11,leftx:a0,lefty:a1,leftstick:b18,rightx:a3,righty:a4,rightstick:b19,leftshoulder:b2,lefttrigger:b0,rightshoulder:b3,righttrigger:b1,back:b13,start:b12,misc1:b21,misc3:b22,guide:b20,paddle1:b14,paddle2:b16,paddle3:b15,paddle4:b17,
```
Then during Setup, select **Paste from Clipboard**.

(If you've already set up your controller, then **Paste from Clipboard** can be found under **Settings** > **Controller** > (your JoyCon 2 pair) > **Test Device Inputs**.)

If successful, it should look like this:

The Capture button will be identified as "M1", the C button will be identified as "M2", and the SL/SR buttons on each JoyCon will be identified as "L4"/"L5"/"R4"/"R5".

Note: There are other options under Settings > Controller that you can enable / explore, like:
- Use Nintendo Button Layout
- Universal Face Button Glyphs (to match Nintendo's UI)
- Test Device Inputs

## **NOTICE !**
**Why is this project temporary ?**  
Currently, Joy-Con 2 controllers only work on Windows. Other operating systems are not supported due to how the controllers communicate. (Due to Joy-Con 2 communication protocol ?)  
  
On this project's [Discord's server](https://discord.gg/LINK_TEMPORARY_REMOVED_BECAUSE_SOME_PEOPLE_DONT_READ_THE_WARNING!!!) somes people work hard to figure out how Switch 2 controllers communicate.  

> [!WARNING]
> **!! This Discord's server is not part of this project, so no help will be provided there !!**  
> For questions or issues, please contact ``octokling`` on Discord or by Issues.

> [!NOTE]  
> I am not a Bluetooth communication expert. I have been helped multiple times to understand how it works.
